# algoexpert-coding-tasks
Looking for ways to sharpen your algo skills and get prepared for interviews? 

**Join our repository of coding tasks & solutions!**

## Objective:
This repository contains groups of frequently asked coding tasks (based on [algoexpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/)) during coding interviews.

> We highly recommend AlgoExpert.io as a great platform to learn and practice coding interview questions

There are **3 main categories** to be explored: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**.

Questions will be published in the links below as we progress completing them.

## Solutions
Each one of the questions will be available in form of a TestNG test class.

### Structure
The **problem statement** will be presented as **comments** at top of the class, while the problem implementation
will be displayed as a **private method** and will be tested against **data samples** as **Test methods**.

### Time and Space Complexity
The **time and space complexity** will be calculated for each solution as well as a brief explanation of its result available in form of comments in the class.

## Categories
